# 👋 Hi, I'm Dallas Plunkett

🎓 4th Year Data Science Student at UC San Diego  
🧠 Lifelong learner | 🛟 Navy Veteran | 📊 Data Enthusiast  

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Data Science, blending a passion for analytics, programming, and impactful storytelling with a strong background in leadership and operations. Before diving into tech, I served as a Rescue Swimmer in the U.S. Navy, where I developed sharp decision-making, coordination, and team management skills under high-stakes conditions. Today, I apply that same discipline and problem-solving mindset to data-driven projects and software engineering.
