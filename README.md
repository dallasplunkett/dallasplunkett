Hi! I’m a 4th-year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I like working with messy data, building performant models, and deploying projects to the web.

#### Projects I'm Proud Of

__Mapping the Spread of Dengue in Colombia__ – An interactive visualization of Dengue fever cases from 2007 to 2018 across Colombian municipalities. Built using D3.js and Python to highlight temporal and geographic trends in disease spread.

__Power Outage Analysis in the U.S.__ – Analyzed power outage records (2000–2016) to uncover patterns in location, duration, and causes. Built a decision tree to predict outage duration and evaluated regional fairness in predictions using hypothesis testing.
