### Hi, Iâ€™m Dallas ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 4th-year Data Science student at UC San Diego, passionate about working with messy data, building effective models, and deploying projects to the web.

Outside of coding and math, youâ€™ll find me hiking, surfing, or tracking down the best burritos in town ðŸŒ¯.

I'm currently looking for a Summer 2025 internship â€” if my skills align with your work, Iâ€™d love to connect and contribute!
