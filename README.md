# 👋 Hi, I'm Dallas

🎓 4th Year Data Science Student at the University of California, San Diego  
🧠 Curious Mind | 📊 Data Enthusiast | 💻 Builder of Meaningful Projects  

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Data Science, blending a passion for analytics, programming, and clear communication. I enjoy using data to tell stories, build tools, and uncover patterns that drive smarter decisions. Whether it’s data visualization, backend work, or scraping messy datasets, I like working on projects that teach me something new and are useful to others.
