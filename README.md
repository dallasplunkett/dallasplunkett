### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dallas

I'm a 4th-year Data Science student at UC San Diego. I like working with messy data, building performant models, and deploying projects to the web. When I'm not coding or doing math, Iâ€™m probably out hiking, surfing, or chowing down on a Cali burrito.

### Projects to Checkout

(Visualizing Dengue in Colombia)[https://mapping-colombia.github.io/colombia/] â€“ An interactive visualization of Dengue fever cases from 2007 to 2018 across Colombian municipalities. Built using D3.js and Python to highlight temporal and geographic trends in disease spread.

(Power Outages Analysis)[https://dallasplunkett.github.io/power_outages/] â€“ Analyzed U.S. power outage records between 2000 and 2016 to uncover patterns in location, duration, and causes. Built a decision tree to predict outage duration and evaluated regional fairness in predictions using hypothesis testing.

### Let's Connect!

If you're into data science, web technologies, or just want to brainstorm project ideas, feel free to explore my repos or reach out here on GitHub.

I'm also looking for a summer internshipâ€“if my skills align with what you're building, Iâ€™d love the opportunity to join!
